		<p id="personaDescription" class="description">Andy Hart: Andy Hart ia a fifty five year old white man currently
			residing in Northwest Albuquerque, New Mexico off of Don Quixote Ct. Andy Hart founded Hart Construction in August 1989
			when he was 25 years old with his college friend Jim Pekin. They still own Hart Construction. Prior to that, he worked
			on a ranch in Chromo Colorado for two years. He has a BA in Studio Art and Art History from Georgetown University. His
			father was a prominent lawyer in Albuquerque and has a building at the University of New Mexico named after him. Andy is
			a serious, busy man who is very concise in his correspondence. He enjoys bass guitar.<br>
		Andy is a windows user and would likely access the website while using Chrome or Internet Explorer on his desktop. He would
			likely visit the website before inviting Rodgers Plumbing and Heating to bid on a project for Hart Construction to see if
			they have worked on projects of a similar scope in the past. He may have previously dealt with subcontractors who were
			unable to complete large projects on schedule. The goal of the website is to give him a good idea of the scale and variety
			of jobs Rodgers Plumbing and Heating has performed along with a few testimonials commenting on the professionalism and
			timeliness of Rodgers Plumbing and Heating.</p>
