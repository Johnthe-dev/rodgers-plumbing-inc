			<h5 id="purposeTitle" class="subtitle">Purpose</h5>
			<p id="purposeDescription" class="description">This website will replace Rodgers Plumbing and Heating's
				current, outdated website with a new, clean, one page website. I hope it will decrease customer confusion
				and better represent the values of Rodgers Plumbing and Heating.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="audience">
			<h5 id="audienceTitle" class="subtitle">Audience</h5>
			<p id="audienceDescription" class="description">The site's audience will be local contractors looking for
				subcontractors to bid on the plumbing aspects of their jobs and homeowners who are looking for a plumbing
				company to perform smaller service calls. I chose to create a persona for "Andy Smith", who will represent a
				contractor looking for a plumbing subcontractor(this is the main source of revenue for Rodgers Plumbing and
				Heating).</p>
		</div>

		<div id="goal">
			<h5 id="goalTitle" class="subtitle">Goal</h5>
			<p id="goalDescription" class="description">The current site is not mobile friendly, contains a lot of
				irrelevant information, and requires a lot of "menu-hopping" to find information that should be readily
				available. I hope that this will be the perfect opportunity to fix that with a clean, simple, and well
				designed website. </p>
