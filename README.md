My Personal Web Page Project will be for a local plumbing company, Rodgers Plumbing and Heating.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
* Your overall look is nice and clear.  Good use of layout and color.
* Your purpose should describe what the purpose of the site is for the end user, rather than you as a developer.  I'm a little fuzzy on what's going on here.  Are homeowners using the site to find contractors?  How is that going to happen?  Are they supposed to be the ones using the site, and then they reach out to Andy via the contact form?  Or is this a site built for Rodgers plumbing and heating and Andy should be able to use the site to find information about them and reach out to them?
* You have some inconsistent indentation.  In general, if you open a multiline tag, everything inside of it should be one level indented. (see lines 9-29).
* You've got a couple unclosed divs (check the W3C validator linked on the assignment for details).
* You should delete code that's unused, rather than leave it around as commented out.  If you need to get back to it, you can always refer to it in git.  This will keep your code more maintainable and reduce file sizes.
* Your meta tag isn't quite right.

Overall, your code quality is good.  You use CSS effectively, as well as have a good structure for your html.  Your git commit history is excellent, and you effectively separate out CSS from your HTML.  However, you've got some validation errors for your code.

My main concern is that I'm not sure what this site is or whether it will fit in the PWP scope.  I'm not clear by who your audience is or how you're going to use it.  The persona suggests one thing, the user story suggests something else, and the audience a third.  Please come talk to me so that I can be sure that you're not going to big for this project and trying to do something that won't fit in the project scope.

With early submission, **this Milestone grades at a Tier III**.
